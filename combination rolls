Here's what has been updated:

Dice Pool and Dice Combination Rolling
The roll_dice method in the DiceRoller class has been modified to handle rolling a combination of dice types, such as "2d6+1d4".
The method splits the dice_type string into individual components using regular expressions.
For each component, it extracts the number of dice and the die size, generates random rolls, and accumulates the results.
The total roll sum and individual roll results are stored in the last_roll_total and last_roll_details instance variables, respectively.
Critical Success/Failure Mechanics
The determine_outcome function has been updated to check for critical success or failure based on the maximum or minimum possible roll values.
It calculates the maximum roll value as the sum of all dice faces (e.g., 21 for 3d6) and the minimum roll value as the number of dice (e.g., 3 for 3d6).
If the roll result matches the maximum roll value, it returns a dictionary indicating a critical success, along with the success outcome details.
If the roll result matches the minimum roll value, it returns a dictionary indicating a critical failure, along with the failure outcome details.
Otherwise, it determines the outcome based on the target number as before.
With these changes, you can now roll a combination of dice types by passing a string like "2d6+1d4" to the roll_dice method. Additionally, the determine_outcome function will automatically detect and handle critical successes and failures based on the maximum and minimum possible roll values.

Note that the success_outcome and failure_outcome dictionaries in the dice roll data should have a 'details' key containing the outcome details to be displayed in case of a critical success or failure.
