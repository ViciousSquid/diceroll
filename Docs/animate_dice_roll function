The <code style="color : name_color">**animate_dice_roll**</code> function provides a visually engaging animation of the dice roll process. It consists of two distinct animation phases: shaking and tumbling.

**Shaking Animation Phase:**

This phase lasts for specified duration <code style="color : name_color">(shake_duration)</code>

During this phase, the following steps occur in a loop:

* The window is cleared with a white background.
* A random dice image from the loaded set is selected and displayed.
* The selected dice image is slightly rotated and offset to create a shaking effect. The rotation angle and offset values are randomly generated for each iteration.
* The rotated and offset dice image is drawn (blitted) onto the window.
* The display is updated to reflect the changes.
* The animation frame rate is limited to 30 frames per second (FPS) for a smoother appearance.
