The dice_sets dictionary is created to store the lists of dice images for each color (red, white, blue, and black).
The dice images are loaded into their respective color lists in the dice_sets dictionary. The script expects the dice images to be in subfolders named red, white, blue, and black inside the images directory.
The animate_dice_roll function now takes an additional parameter dice_color to specify the color of the dice set to use. It retrieves the random dice images from the corresponding color list in dice_sets.
The perform_dice_roll function also takes an additional parameter dice_color and passes it to the animate_dice_roll function.
In the main function, the initial dice_color is set to 'red'.
Additional keyboard events are handled in the main function to change the dice_color based on the pressed key ('r' for red, 'w' for white, 'b' for blue, and 'k' for black).
