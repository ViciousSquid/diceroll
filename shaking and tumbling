The animate_dice_roll function includes two separate animation phases: shaking and tumbling.
The shaking animation is performed for a specified duration (shake_duration). During this phase:
The window is cleared with a white background.
A random dice image is selected and displayed with a slight rotation and offset.
The rotation angle and offset values are randomly generated to create a shaking effect.
The rotated dice image is blitted onto the window at the adjusted position.
The display is updated, and the animation frame rate is limited to 20 FPS.
The tumbling animation is performed for a specified duration (tumble_duration). During this phase:
The window is cleared with a white background.
A random dice image is selected and displayed with a rotation.
The rotation angle is calculated based on the elapsed time and the total tumble duration, creating a continuous tumbling effect.
The rotated dice image is blitted onto the window at the center position.
The display is updated, and the animation frame rate is limited to 60 FPS.
After the shaking and tumbling animations, the actual dice roll is performed using the roll_dice function.
The final dice image based on the roll result is displayed, and there is a short delay to show the final result before returning the roll result.
when you run the perform_dice_roll function, you will see the dice shaking and tumbling before settling on the final numbers.

Adjust the shake_duration and tumble_duration values to customize the animation durations according to your preference
